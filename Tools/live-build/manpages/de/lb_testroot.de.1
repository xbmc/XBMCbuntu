.TH LIVE\-BUILD 1 2011\-10\-30 3.0~a38\-1 "Debian Live Project"

.SH NAME
\fBlb testroot\fP \- Ensure that a system is built as root

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlb testroot\fP [\fIlive\-build options\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBlb testroot\fP is a high\-level command (porcelain) of \fIlive\-build\fP(7), the
Debian Live tool suite.
.PP
.\" FIXME
\fBlb testroot\fP simply checks to see if you are root. If not, it exits with
an error. Debian Live images must currently be built as real root.
.PP
.\" FIXME
Note: Support for using \fIfakeroot\fP(1) and \fIsudo\fP(8) internally in
live\-build itself is still experimental, however, calling a helper yourself
with sudo is safe.

.SH OPTIONS
\fBlb testroot\fP has no specific options but understands all generic
live\-build options. See \fIlive\-build\fP(7) for a complete list of all generic
live\-build options.
