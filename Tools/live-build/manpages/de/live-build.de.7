.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" FIXME
live\-build is a set of scripts to build Debian Live system images. The idea
behind live\-build is a tool suite that uses a configuration directory to
completely automate and customize all aspects of building a Live image.
.PP
The \fICOMMAND\fP is a name of a live\-build command (see below).
.PP
.\" FIXME
More documentation about how to use live\-build is available in the
individual manpages for each helper and in the manual at
<\fIhttp://live.debian.net/manual/\fP>.

.SH OPTIONS
.\" FIXME
.SS "Shared live\-build options"
The following command line options are supported by all live\-build programs.
.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP" 4
display help and exit.
.IP "\fB\-u, \-\-usage\fP" 4
show usage and exit.
.IP "\fB\-v, \-\-version\fP" 4
output version information and exit.
.SS "Common live\-build options"
The following command line options are supported by most live\-build
programs. See the man page of each program for a complete explanation of
what each option does.
.IP \fB\-\-breakpoints\fP 4
run with breakpoints.
.IP \fB\-\-conffile\fP 4
use custom configuration file.
.IP \fB\-\-debug\fP 4
show debug information.
.IP \fB\-\-force\fP 4
force helper execution, even if stage file exists.
.IP \fB\-\-quiet\fP 4
be quiet.
.IP \fB\-\-verbose\fP 4
.\" FIXME
be verbose.

.SH "LIVE\-BUILD COMMANDS"
.\" FIXME
We divide live\-build into high level ("porcelain") commands and low level
("plumbing") commands.
.PP
.\" FIXME
Here is the complete list of all available live\-build commands. See their
man pages for additional documentation.

.SH "HIGH\-LEVEL COMMANDS (PORCELAIN)"
.\" FIXME
We separate the porcelain commands into the main commands and some ancillary
user utilities.
.SS "Main porcelain commands"
.IP \fBlb_config\fP(1) 4
create configuration for live\-build
.IP \fBlb_bootstrap\fP(1) 4
create the first stage by bootstrapping a basic debian system
.IP \fBlb_chroot\fP(1) 4
create the second stage by customizing the chroot
.IP \fBlb_binary\fP(1) 4
create the third stage by generating a binary image
.IP \fBlb_source\fP(1) 4
create the optional fourth stage by generating a source image
.IP \fBlb_clean\fP(1) 4
clean up system build directories
.SS "Ancillary Commands"
.IP \fBlb\fP(1) 4
generic live\-build wrapper
.IP \fBlb_build\fP(1) 4
alias for all stages
.IP \fBlb_local\fP(1) 4
helper for using a local live\-build
.IP \fBlb_testroot\fP(1) 4
.\" FIXME
ensure that a system is built as root

.SH "LOW\-LEVEL COMMANDS (PLUMBING)"
.\" FIXME
The actual work of live\-build is implemented in the low\-level commands,
called plumbing. They are not supposed to be used by end users, they should
stick with porcelains as they ensure that all the different plumbing
commands are executed in the right order. However, if you intend to reuse
live\-build commands in your own scripts, then the plumbings might be of
interest for you.
.PP
Note that the interface (set of options and the semantics) to these
low\-level commands are meant to be a lot more stable than Porcelain level
commands. The interface to Porcelain commands on the other hand are subject
to change in order to improve the end user experience.

.SH "CONFIG FILES"
.\" FIXME
Many live\-build commands make use of files in the \fIconfig/\fP directory to
control what they do. Besides the common \fIconfig/common\fP, which is used by
all live\-build commands, some additional files can be used to configure the
behavior of specific live\-build commands. These files are typically named
config/stage or config/stage_helper (where "stage" of course, is replaced
with the name of the stage that they belong to, and "helper" with the name
of the helper).
.PP
For example, lb_bootstrap_debootstrap uses files named config/bootstrap and
config/bootstrap_debootstrap to read the options it will use. See the man
pages of individual commands for details about the names and formats of the
files they use. Generally, these files contain variables with values
assigned, one variable per line. Some programs in live\-build use pairs of
values or slightly more complicated variable assignments.
.PP
Note that live\-build will respect environment variables which are present in
the context of the shell it is running. If variables can be read from config
files, then they override environment variables, and if command line options
are used, they override values from config files. If no value for a given
variable can be found and thus is unset, live\-build will automatically set
it to the default value.
.PP
In some rare cases, you may want to have different versions of these files
for different architectures or distributions. If files named
config/stage.arch or config/stage_helper.arch, and config/stage.dist or
config/stage_helper.dist exist, where "arch" is the same as the output of
"dpkg \-\-print\-architecture" and "dist" is the same as the codename of the
target distribution, then they will be used in preference to other, more
general files.
.PP
.\" FIXME
All config files are shell scripts which are sourced by a live\-build
program. That means they have to follow the normal shell syntax. You can
also put comments in these files; lines beginning with "#" are ignored.
