                      Welcome to the exciting world of
                              Debian GNU/Linux

   This disc contains the installer for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution.
   Debian is a very extensive collection of software. But it is more. It
   is a complete Operating System (OS) for your computer. And it is free
   (as in "freedom").

Introduction
============

   An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that
   make your computer run. At the core of an operating system is the
   kernel. The kernel is the most fundamental program on the computer,
   which does all the basic housekeeping and lets you start other
   programs. Debian is kernel independent. It currently uses the Linux
   kernel but work is in progress to provide Debian for other kernels,
   using the Hurd. Most of the basic operating system tools come from the
   GNU project; hence the name GNU/Linux.

   Debian is available for various kinds of computers ("architectures"),
   like "IBM-compatible" PCs (i386), Compaq's Alpha, Sun's Sparc,
   Motorola/IBM's PowerPC, and (Strong)ARM processors. Check the ports
   page for more information.

About This Disc
===============

   This disc is labeled

     Debian GNU/Linux squeeze-di-rc2 "Squeeze" - Official Snapshot i386
                       NETINST Binary-1 20110121-20:12

   It contains programs ("binaries") for `i386' computers.

   This disc is a netinst image. It contains the installer and a very
   basic system. Any other packages you might want to install will be
   downloaded from the network.

Installing
==========

   Because Debian is a complete Operating System, the installation
   procedure may seem a bit unusual. You can install Debian GNU/Linux
   either alongside your current OS, or as the only OS on your computer.

   As this is not an official squeeze release disc, then the installation
   guide many not be released yet. It will appear on the Debian web site
   when ready, but before then you could try the development version of
   the manual.

   For the impatient ones: you can start the installation program easily
   by booting off this disc. Note that not all (esp. older) systems
   support this.

   You can also examine the /install/ directory; you might be able to
   start the installation system directly from there.

Last-Minute Notes
=================

     * You should keep in mind that this is a beta disc of the current
       development version of the Debian system. This means that all sorts
       of bugs may be present anywhere in the system. Please report any
       bugs you find in the Debian Bug Tracking System; details at
       bugs.debian.org.
     * If you're reporting bugs against this disc or the installation
       system, please also mention the version of this disc; this can be
       found in the file /.disk/info.

Installing software using Apt
=============================

   After installing or upgrading, Debian's packaging system can use CDs,
   DVDs, local collections, or networked servers (FTP, HTTP) to
   automatically install software from (.deb packages). This is done
   preferably with the `apt' and `aptitude' programs.

   You can install packages from the commandline using apt-get. For
   example, if you want to install the packages `commprog' and `maxgame',
   you can give the command:

     apt-get install commprog maxgame

   Note that you don't have to enter the complete path, or the `.deb'
   extension. `Apt' will figure this out itself.

   Or use aptitude for a full screen interactive selection of available
   Debian packages.

CD/DVD Manufacturers
====================

   You are completely free to manufacture and re-distribute CDs/DVDs of
   the Debian GNU/Linux Operating System, like this one. There is no
   charge from us (but of course donations are always welcome).
