# /usr/share/live/build/package-lists/minimal - package list for live-build(7)

# Warning: if you only use this list directly, not inherited through e.g.
# standard, then live-build also triggers the minimal hook and some other
# things to make the image smaller. This can lead to breakages at any time,
# don't use it if you're not willing/capable of fixing any arising issues.
